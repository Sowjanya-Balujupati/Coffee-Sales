The main aim of the project is to compare the total sales from 2019 to 2022 split by 4 different coffee types Arabica, Excelsa, Libreca, Robusta and also to compare the total sales by country. 

In this project, we are comparing the sales in 3 countries - US, Ireland and UK. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, the profits trends were visualized by country, roast type, size, loyality card and timeline(months).
